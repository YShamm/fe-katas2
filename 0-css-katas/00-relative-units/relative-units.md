# Relative units

In CSS, relative length units are units that are relative in size to something else, e.g. the size of their parent element.

## Types of relative units in CSS

- `em`
- `rem`
- `vh`
- `vw`
- `line-height`

There are a few others; however, these are the ones we will use for this kata!
