# Colours

It's time to look at colours! CSS offers so many different ways in which we can add colour to our styling! It really is an endless adventure!

This kata will require you to colour in some flags from around the world using the different colouring options available to us in CSS.

Take some time to look up:

- web colours(generic colours available to us in CSS)

```css
.flag {
  background-colour: green;
}
```

- Hexidecimal colour codes

```css
.flag {
  background-colour: #3f3f3f;
}
```

- RGB colour codes

```css
.flag {
  background-colour: rgb(34, 45, 234);
}
```

- HSL colour codes

```css
.flag {
  background-colour: hsl(45, 100%, 50%);
}
```
