# The CSS box model

## Everything is a box üó≥Ô∏è

On a webpage, everything is a box. Whether it's a `<div>`, `<ul>`, `<p>`, `<span>` or anything else, it will be positioned and rendered in a rectangle.

The shape, size, and exact positioning of an element will depend on various properties including:

- `display`
- `padding`
- `margin`
- `border`
- `box-sizing`
- and more...

## `block` and `inline`

Most HTML Elements have some default styling applied to them, and you can read about them [here](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_default_values.asp).

For example, a `<div>` will, by default, have:

```css
display: block;
```

`block` will cause elements to:

- Break onto a new line
- Take up the horizontal space of its parent element

`inline` will cause elements to:

- **Not** break onto a new line
- Take up only the horizontal space of its contents + padding

You may overwrite an HTML element's default styling by using CSS.

## `box-sizing`

In the standard box model, the `height` and `width` affects the inner content's box of an element _only_.

This can make things a bit confusing because `height` and `width` are **not** the actual height and width of the element - there's padding and border added on!

To make things simpler, you can choose to use the alternate box model which sets the size of the inner content's box to be `height` and `width` _minus_ `padding` and `border`. This way, `height` and `width` will be the actual size of the element!

The `box-sizing` attibute can be used to switch between the standard box model and the alternate box model.

```css
/* standard */
box-sizing: content-box;
/* alternate */
box-sizing: border-box;
```
