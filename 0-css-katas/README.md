# FE CSS Katas

A series of challenges cover a variety of CSS and HTML topics

Make your way through the challenges as they are numbered. There are some `additional` challenges for colours and how to select elements in CSS. If you are not familiar with these topics have a look at them first.

Read the markdown file for each topic carefully - the challenges have specific instructions on how to complete them!

**tip** In VSCode if you right click a markdown file you can `Open Preview` render the markdown formatting. This will let you easily view the associated images.

Once you have completed a task take a screenshot of your result and add it to your repo!
