## Goals

- Understand what accessibility is (and isn't)
- Be able to use basic implementation of features that can aid accessibility
- Become familiar with tools that can help us code more accessibly

üí° Important: this is not a design challenge. The focus is on getting familiar with accessible practices. We don't care if your page is not jazzy or pretty. As a developer, you will often have a UI and/or UX team in charge of branding, colours, etc. whose designs you will follow. Being a front end developer is not the same as being a designer. For this sprint, the content is also not particularly important, but try to have fun with it!

‚≠êÔ∏è There is a `resources` folder in the main sprint folder which points you in the right direction for images, fonts, etc. There is also an example page for inspiration.

Tasks

- Pre-sprint
  - Before starting the main task, please navigate to the pre-sprint folder and try to fix the ten issues with the HTML file that's in the folder. `axe`, `lighthouse` or `wave` may help here, but it's your job to fix the errors!
  - You can install extensions on Chrome for `axe` and `wave`. [Add axe here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd?hl=en-US). [Add WAVE here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh)
- Main sprint
  - Create a page for a business that takes bookings for something. It could be a hairdressers, cake shop, some kind of sport - anything you like!
  - Be sure to use accessible coding practices and to 'test' your code using some of the tools we have looked at. Try to remember the easy wins when it comes to making an accessible page :)
  - Besides the basic content of a header, content and so forth, the page should include the following as a minimum:
    - [ ] a form
    - [ ] a menu
    - [ ] a hyperlink leading to another website
    - [ ] at least one image
    - [ ] at least three headings

Advanced Tasks

- Implement styling with a tool like Flexbox, Grid, or even a UI library like Bootstrap, MUI, or similar!
- Make the page responsive so that it can be accessed with multiple devices
- Explore some more difficult aspects of accessibility, such as ARIA
- Add the ability to switch to dark mode OR to switch to the background and colour of your choice!
