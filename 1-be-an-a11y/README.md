üí° Important: this is not a design challenge. The focus is on getting familiar with accessible practices. We don't care if your page is not jazzy or pretty. As a developer, you will often have a UI and/or UX team in charge of branding, colours, etc. whose designs you will follow. Being a front end developer is not the same as being a designer. For this sprint, the content is also not particularly important, but try to have fun with it!

## Tasks

There are 10 bad practices that have purposefully been left in the HTML file.

1. Fix the tags on the page to be more semantic
2. Check out the contrast of colours used. Do they pass?
3. Buttons are for actions. Anchor tags are for links. Can you find somewhere where a button has been misused?
4. Fix the image alt text
5. Where is the link going to? Can you improve the description?
6. There's a distinct lack of headings on this page. Let's fix that!
7. I can't see red - uh oh! How will I find the right button to click? Fix the instructions for signing up.
8. Our button just says click me - that's not very helpful! Change it :)
9. The menu is in the wrong place in the DOM. Where should it go instead?
10. The menu could have a better, more semantic tag

_BONUS_
How could we offer users a way to jump to the main content on the page? Investigate `skip to content links` as a good way of achieving this.

## Advanced Tasks

- Implement styling with a tool like Flexbox, Grid, or even a UI library like Bootstrap, MUI, or similar!
- Make the page responsive so that it can be accessed with multiple devices
- Explore some more difficult aspects of accessibility, such as ARIA
- Add the ability to switch to dark mode OR to switch to the background and colour of your choice!
