# Resources

This is not an exhaustive list of resources. This is intended to point you in the right direction if you're wondering where to start looking ðŸ”Ž

## Images

You can find images that are royalty free in places like Pexels, Unsplash, and Pixabay. We don't technically need to use royalty free/open source for these small, non-commercial projects, but it's always best to try to use images you have the permission to use!

## Dummy text

Emmet, which is included with VS Code, has a `lorem ipsum` generator included. If you want to add some filler text, you can type something like `lorem10` then press `tab` to create dummy text like this "Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Sapiente, voluptatem." The 10 in `lorem10` refers to how many words you want to generate. If you search Google for lorem ipsum generators, you will find a variety of themed ones like 'hipster' or 'zombie', which throw out random related words for fun dummy text.

## Dummy links

For external links, feel free to send people to Google or a random Wikipedia page. It's not really important for this project where the link goes as long as it's not to a harmful or offensive site.

## Icons

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) offers a large library of icons for everything from social media to delete icons to food.

[Octicons](https://primer.style/octicons/) is the icon library from GitHub. They are pretty simple and limited.

[Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) offer various icons which you can preview in dark and light mode.

## Design help

[Coolors](https://coolors.co/) is a great place to find a nice colour scheme if that kind of thing stresses you out. Try to stick to two or three colours when designing a page. Coolors also has a checker for background colour and text.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) has a whole host of fonts you can import to jazz up your page.
