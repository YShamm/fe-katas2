## Issues to fix

There are 10 bad practces that have purposefully been left in the HTML file.

1. Fix the tags on the page to be more semantic
2. Check out the contrast of colours used. Do they pass?
3. Buttons are for actions. Anchor tags are for links. Can you find somewhere where a button has been misused?
4. Fix the image alt text
5. Where is the link going to? Can you improve the description?
6. There's a distinct lack of headings on this page. Let's fix that!
7. I can't see red - uh oh! How will I find the right button to click? Fix the instructions for signing up.
8. Our button just says click me - that's not very helpful! Change it :)
9. The menu is in the wrong place in the DOM. Where should it go instead?
10. The menu could have a better, more semantic tag

BONUS
How could we offer users a way to jump to the main content on the page?
