# Northcoders Front End Afternoon Katas

## Running Order

The running order for this block's katas:

### Week 1: `0-css-katas`

A series of challenges cover a variety of CSS topics.
Read the markdown file for each kata carefully - the challenges have specific instructions on how to complete them. Each html file is designed to opened with `Live Server` so that it appropriate CSS files can be linked.

_tip_ In VSCode if you right click a markdown file you can `Open Preview`. This will render the markdown and let you easily view the associated images.

Once you have completed a task take a screenshot of your result and add it to your repo.
