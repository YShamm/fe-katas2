# Northcoders Front End Afternoon Katas

## Running Order

The running order for this block's katas:

### Week 1: `0-css-katas`

A series of challenges that cover a variety of CSS topics.
Read the markdown file for each kata carefully - the challenges have specific instructions on how to complete them. Each html file is designed to be opened with `Live Server` so that the appropriate CSS files can be linked.

_tip_ In VSCode if you right click a markdown file you can select `Open Preview`. This will render the markdown and let you easily view the associated images.

Once you have completed a task take a screenshot of your result and add it to your repo.

### Week 2: `1-be-an-a11y`

`fixme.html` is a page that's already setup but the devs have done a poor job with the a11y. Your job is to fix these issues, there's a list of things to consider in the `README`.

Tools like [axe](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd), [lighthouse](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=en) or [wave](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) may help here, but it's your job to fix the errors!

### Week 3: `2-js-katas`
