# Northcoders Front End Afternoon Katas

## Running Order

The running order for this block's katas:

### Week 1: `0-css-katas`

Instructions for week 1 katas are found here: 
https://l2c.northcoders.com/courses/fe/fe-katas-week-1

### Week 2: `1-be-an-a11y`

`fixme.html` is a page that's already setup but the devs have done a poor job with the a11y. Your job is to fix these issues, there's a list of things to consider in the `README`.

Tools like [axe](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd), [lighthouse](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=en) or [wave](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) may help here, but it's your job to fix the errors!

### Week 3: `2-js-katas`

Problem solving skills are essential and you should practice them regularly to keep them sharp. Each kata has an associated `.md` file with the instructions and a test file already setup. Work through the katas in here in the following order:

1. findMostRepeated
2. csvParser
3. binarySearch
4. subArrSum
5. romanNumeralEncoder
